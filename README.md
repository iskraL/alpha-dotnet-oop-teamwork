The purpouse of our project, despite of helping
pupils take advantage in their exams, is to calculate
mathematical expressions. This is done by the implimentation
of two algorithms known as Shunting-yard and Reversed Polish Notation.
For the sake of convinience the program includes a full cover of incorrect
user input fixes and exception handlings. To maintain these fine functionallities, 
behind stands a code written to follow the best practices for object-oriented design.
